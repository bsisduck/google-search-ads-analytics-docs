This guide outlines common troubleshooting steps to fix common implementation
errors.

No events
---------

If your events aren't showing up in Google Analytics, there are a few common
issues you should look for.

First choose your client:

Firebase
gtag.js

* Are you using the correct [api\_secret](/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/reference#api_secret)?

  Check that you're using the `api_secret` for the right stream. If you set up
  the measurement protocol for multiple streams, each stream will have its own
  secret.
* Is your [api\_secret](/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/reference#api_secret) still valid?

  In order to help combat spam, you're able to revoke `api_secret`s. Make sure
  that the `api_secret` you are using is still valid. It's possible that
  another user with access to your stream may have revoked access to it by
  mistake.
* Is your [api\_secret](/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/reference#api_secret) copied correctly?

  `api_secret` is case-sensitive. Double check that the `api_secret` in the
  Google Analytics UI is *exactly* the same as the one you're using in your
  code.
* Don't use `advertising_id`.

  `advertising_id` is not supported as a valid device identifier. Use
  `app_instance_id` if you're using Firebase and `client_id` if you're using
  gtag.js.

* Are you using the correct [`client_id`](/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/reference?client_type=gtag#client_id)?

  Make sure you're using the `client_id` for the correct property. See
  [send event to the Measurement Protocol](/gtagjs/reference/api#get_mp_example).

Invalid IDs
-----------

Since the Measurement Procotol supports IDs from the Google Analytics for
Firebase SDK and gtag.js, make sure you use the right ID. **The IDs you should
use changes depending on whether you are using the Google Analytics for Firebase
SDK or gtag.js.** The following outlines which IDs you should be using:

**Google Analytics for Firebase SDK**

If you're using the Google Analytics for Firebase SDK the IDs you *should* use
are:

* [`firebase_app_id`](/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/reference?client_type=firebase#firebase_app_id) - Include this ID in the query parameters for the
  request. This ID uniquely identifies your Firebase App. All users of your
  app will have the same `firebase_app_id`. Found in the Firebase console
  under:   
  **Project Settings** > **General** > **Your Apps** > **App ID**
* [`app_instance_id`](/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/reference?client_type=firebase#app_instance_id) - Include this ID in the POST body for the request. This
  ID uniquely identifies a given installation of a Firebase App. This value
  will be different for every installation of your app. The methods to request
  this value for each Firebase platform are as follows:

  + [Android - getAppInstanceId()](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/analytics/FirebaseAnalytics#public-taskstring-getappinstanceid)
  + [Kotlin - getAppInstanceId()](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/kotlin/com/google/firebase/analytics/FirebaseAnalytics#getappinstanceid)
  + [Swift - appInstanceID()](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/swift/firebaseanalytics/api/reference/Classes/Analytics#appinstanceid)
  + [Objective-C - appInstanceID](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/ios/firebaseanalytics/api/reference/Classes/FIRAnalytics#+appinstanceid)
  + [C++ - GetAnalyticsInstanceId()](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/cpp/namespace/firebase/analytics#getanalyticsinstanceid)
  + [Unity - GetAnalyticsInstanceIdAsync()](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/unity/class/firebase/analytics/firebase-analytics#getanalyticsinstanceidasync)

You should *not* use the following:

* `firebase_instance_id` - This ID *should not* be included in your request.
  This ID is used for identifiying a given instance of the app, but is
  Firebase specific. It's used for tasks such as FCM messages.

**gtag.js**

If you're using gtag.js, the IDs you *should* use are:

* [`measurement_id`](/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/reference?client_type=gtag#measurement_id) - Include this ID in the query parameters for the
  request. This ID uniquely identifies a Data Stream. All users of your
  website will have the same `measurement_id`. Found in the Google Analytics
  UI under:   
  **Admin** > **Data Streams** > **choose your stream** > **Measurement ID**
* [`client_id`](/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/reference?client_type=gtag#client_id) - Include this ID in the POST body for the request. This ID
  uniquely identifies a given user instance of a web client. This value will
  be different for every user of your app. See [these examples](/gtagjs/reference/api#get)
  for how to retrieve this value.

Server-side tagging events missing
----------------------------------

A [Server-side Tag Manager installation with a Measurement Protocol
client](/tag-platform/tag-manager/server-side/send-data#server-to-server_apps) lets you send events in the Measurement Protocol *format* to a
container. The container then sends those events to Google Analytics using the
same mechanism as all other SGTM events.

**Note:** It *doesn't* send those events to the Measurement Protocol endpoint, and therefore
doesn't support all the features of the Measurement Protocol endpoint, such as deriving
[geographic and device information](/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4#geo_device) from tagging events.

If you want all the features of the Measurement Protocol, send events directly to the
Measurement Protocol instead of your container.
