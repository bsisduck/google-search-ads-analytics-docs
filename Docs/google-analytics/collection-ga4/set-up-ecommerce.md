This tutorial shows you how to set up a `purchase` event on your website so you
can measure when someone makes a purchase. The tutorial includes the dimensions,
metrics, and reports that Analytics populates with data from the event. To learn
more about the ecommerce events, see [Measure ecommerce](/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/ecommerce).

Before you begin
----------------

This tutorial assumes that you've done the following:

* [Create a Google Analytics account and property](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153#account)
* [Create a web data stream for your website](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153#stream&zippy=%2Cweb)
* [Place the Google Analytics tag on your website](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153#add-tag&zippy=%2Cadd-the-google-tag-directly-to-your-web-pages)

It also assumes that you have the following:

* Access to your website source code
* The Editor (or above) role to the Google Analytics account

Step 1: Add the event to your website
-------------------------------------

You should place [the `purchase` event](/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/reference/events#purchase) on the page of your website where
someone makes a purchase. For example, you could add the event on the
confirmation page that appears when someone makes a purchase. This tutorial
shows you how to add the event to a page where someone clicks a "Purchase"
button.

Place the event in a `<script>` tag at the end of the `<body>` tag. Placing the
event directly in the `<script>` tag triggers the event when the page loads. The
next section describes how to trigger the event when someone clicks "Purchase".

          affiliation: "Google Merchandise Store",

          quantity: 3
        }]
    });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Step 2: Connect the event to a button
-------------------------------------

You can set up the `purchase` event so it triggers when someone clicks a
"Purchase" button in a few ways. One way is to add an ID to the "Purchase"
button and then place the event code in an event listener. In the following
example, the event is only sent when someone clicks a button with the ID
`purchase`.

          });
      });

</body>
</html>
```

Step 3: Verify that you're collecting the data
----------------------------------------------

The [*DebugView* report](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7201382) shows realtime data from your website so you can make
sure you're setting up events correctly. To enable debug mode on a web page, add
the following `debug_mode` parameter to the `config` command:

```

  replace "TAG_ID" with your tag ID.

    <!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->
    <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=TAG_ID"></script>
    <script>
        window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
        function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
        gtag('js', new Date());

        gtag('config', 'TAG_ID',{ 'debug_mode': true });
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <div>This is where the purchase form would go</div>
    <button id="purchase">Purchase</button>
    <script>
    document.getElementById("purchase").addEventListener("click", function () {
        gtag("event", "purchase", {
                // This purchase event uses a different transaction ID
                // from the previous purchase event so Analytics
                // doesn't deduplicate the events.
                // Learn more: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12313109
                transaction_id: "T_12345_3",
                value: 30.03,
                tax: 4.90,
                shipping: 5.99,
                currency: "USD",
                coupon: "SUMMER_SALE",
                items: [
                {
                  item_id: "SKU_12345",
                  item_name: "Stan and Friends Tee",
                  affiliation: "Google Merchandise Store",
                  coupon: "SUMMER_FUN",
                  discount: 2.22,
                  index: 0,
                  item_brand: "Google",
                  item_category: "Apparel",
                  item_category2: "Adult",
                  item_category3: "Shirts",
                  item_category4: "Crew",
                  item_category5: "Short sleeve",
                  item_list_id: "related_products",
                  item_list_name: "Related Products",
                  item_variant: "green",
                  location_id: "ChIJIQBpAG2ahYAR_6128GcTUEo",
                  price: 10.01,
                  quantity: 3
                }]
        });
    });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Once you enable debug mode, you will start to see events populate the
*DebugView* report as people use your website. For example, clicking the
"Purchase" button on your website populates the report with the following data.
You can select an event to see the parameters, user properties, and items
associated with the event.

![A screenshot of the DebugView report](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/img/debug-view.png)

Step 4: See your ecommerce data
-------------------------------

After about 24 hours, the data you sent with the `purchase` event becomes
available in your [reports](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9212670), [explorations](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7579450), and [Google Analytics Data API](/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1).
You can also access the data in BigQuery when you [set up BigQuery Export](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9823238).

The "purchase" event automatically populates a variety of prebuilt [dimensions
and metrics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9143382), which are used in reports and explorations. The
following are some of the dimensions that are populated with data from the
`purchase` event in the first step:

| Parameter | Dimension | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `affiliation` | *Item affiliation* | Google Merchandise Store |
| `currency` | *Currency* | USD |
| `discount` | *Item discount amount* | 2.22 |
| `index` | *Item list position* | 0 |
| `item_brand` | *Item brand* | Google |
| `item_category` | *Item category* | Apparel |
| `item_id` | *Item ID* | SKU\_12345 |
| `item_list_id` | *Item list ID* | related\_products |
| `item_list_name` | *Item list name* | Related Products |
| `item_name` | *Item name* | Stan and Friends Tee |
| `item_variant` | *Item variant* | green |
| `location_id` | *Item location ID* | ChIJIQBpAG2ahYAR\_6128GcTUEo (the Google Place ID for San Francisco) |
| `shipping` | *Shipping amount* | 5.99 |
| `tax` | *Tax amount* | 4.90 |
| `transaction_id` | *Transaction ID* | T\_12345 |

In addition to the dimensions, Google Analytics populates a number of ecommerce
and revenue-related metrics. For example, if a user clicks the "Purchase" button
once, then the following metrics are populated in Google Analytics:

* *Item revenue* metric has a value of $30.03
* *Total revenue* metric has a value of $30.03
* *Ecommerce purchases* metric has a value of 1

You can use these dimensions and metrics to build explorations and custom
reports, but you can also use the following prebuilt [*Ecommerce purchases*
report](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9786881) to see your ecommerce data:

report](/static/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/img/ecommerce-purchases-report.png)
