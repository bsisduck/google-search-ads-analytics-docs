Visual Elements gallery of Google Search
========================================

Visual elements are the building blocks of the Google Search results page that a user can
perceive or interact with. The Visual Elements gallery is an illustrated guide to the most
common UI elements of Google web search: it explains what the elements look like, what they're
called, and whether you can optimize your website for each element.

Anatomy of a Google Search results page
---------------------------------------

The Google Search results page contains a set of different types of search result visual
elements, and each search result has its own set of possible child visual elements. For example,
a *text result* is a visual element in its own right, and it has various child visual
elements, such as attribution, title link, and snippet.

How the visual elements look can change over time, and a given result can be displayed
differently depending on whether you're using a desktop computer or a phone, what country
you're in, the language of your search query, and many other factors. Here are the most
common types of search result visual elements that you might see in Google Search:

Attribution
-----------

Attribution describes the source of a search result, and can appear for a variety of search
result types, including text, image, and video results. Attribution can include various
aspects of the source, such as the name of the site, favicon, and URL to the web page.

Text result
-----------

A *text result* (formerly known as a "web result" or "plain blue link") is a result in
Google Search that's based on the textual content of the
page. It includes visual elements such as attribution, title link, and snippet.

A text result may also include additional visual elements like rich attributes or a
sitelinks group; keep in mind that a given text result may display differently depending on
a variety of factors, like what device you're using, what you searched for, or what language
you're using. You won't see a text result that includes all of the possible visual elements.

For example, the links could be other pages on that domain, headings, or anchors within that page.  A sitelinks group contains two or more sitelinks:   |  |  | | --- | --- | | Sitelink | A single link within a sitelinks group. While sitelinks are automated, there are some [best practices you can follow for improving the quality](/search/docs/appearance/sitelinks#sitelinks-best-practices). | |

### Text result image

A *text result image* is the most relevant image from that particular web page for the given query. Tapping it takes the user to the web
page that's embedding the image. A text result image is more likely to appear for image-seeking
queries.

To optimize for a text result image, follow the [Image SEO best practices](/search/docs/appearance/google-images).

### Rich attributes

*Rich attributes* are one or more lines of additional information about the web page,
such as review stars and recipe information. This information is typically powered by
[structured data](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data),
provided by you.

Exploration features
--------------------

Exploration features help searchers explore more questions or searches that are related to
their original search query (also known as "People also ask"). While you can't control what
shows up here, it can be helpful to pay attention to the related search queries when you're
thinking about topics you could write about for your site.

### Related searches group

![An illustration of how a related searches group could look in Google Search, which shows a series of related things that other people have searched for](/static/search/docs/images/related-searches-group.png)

A *related searches group* is a cluster of related searches that other people have done. Tapping or clicking a related search takes
the user to another search results page. These searches are automatically generated based on
the initial query and other things people have searched for.

### Related questions group

![An illustration of how a related questions group could look in Google Search, which shows a series of questions that are related to what the user initially searched for](/static/search/docs/images/related-questions-group.png)

A *related questions group* is a cluster of questions that are related to what the user initially searched for (also known as
"People Also Ask"). When a user expands the question, they're shown a featured snippet.
Learn how to [manage featured snippets](/search/docs/appearance/featured-snippets).
